# Dystopia Rising Survivor's Guide 2.0.1

A project to make the Dystopia Rising Survivor's Guide 2.0 stop making the Baby Jesus weep tears of acid. "Theif", really?

## Milestone 1: Run !@#$ing spell check

Focus strictly on mechanical errors: spelling, punctuation, and grammar. Avoid any non-essential changes to language. 

The goal of milestone 1 is not to investigate or clarify intent, nor to make structural improvements, merely to clean up the trash.

## Milestone 2: Simple clarifications

Limited to existing rules and descriptions where language is unclear and can be easily fixed. 

The goal of milestone 2 is not to consider how the current rules do and don't function well, merely to reduce textual barriers to understanding the existing system.

## Milestone 3: Big, hairy questions

We'll cross that bridge if we ever come to it.
