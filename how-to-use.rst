How to Use This Book
====================

This is a pretty damned big book.

However, this is not just a book of rules. All in all, the actual rules and mechanics of a Dystopia Rising LARP probably take less than 30 pages. The reason why this book is so thick is that we have a lot of different subject matters in here, because while we hope you may read the Dystopia Rising game books that this LARP is based on, we have to sadly assume that there is a very real chance that you may not read them.

This means that we have fit a wide variety of subject matter into a single book. If you are the reading sort, and good on you if you are, then feel free to read this entire book as well as all of the details of the table top world in the other books. There are thousands of pages of materials available for you to have a better understanding of the world.

However, if you are just looking for what you need to play, here is what we suggest. Read the entire section entitled ‘Flesh.’ This covers a lot of the basics and our community guidelines. Community is very important to us, and, we want to make sure that you are a part of it. You will probably find that most of the materials in the Flesh section are no-brainers, focused on the ideas of common decency and fair play. You may learn a bit here and there, but if we didn’t write these rules down someone may very well say, _Well you never told us._

While no book is all-inclusive and covers every subject in the detail level that it needs, we strive to find a nice balance between giving exhaustive detail and keeping things short enough that you might just read it.

Next, flip to character creation in the Blood section. If you follow the steps of character creation, you will easily make your character. If you have a hard time with character creation, it’s no big deal. Each Branch of Dystopia Rising will have people that will help you make your character. If you do make your character yourself, though, remember to read the Skills you have. This will let you know what your character will do.

Skip everything about Profession Concentrations and Advanced Professions and go straight to the section entitled Bone. In the Bone section you will find a really large section that tries to encompass every potential rule scenario that could exist (and with as many players and branches as we have, there is no doubt we still missed thousands of things they will think up later). What is important for you is reading the Mechanical Interaction section. Most of this will be reviewed when you go to an event and get your new player training, but it’s good to at least have read it once beforehand.

Lastly, check out some of the world materials in the Bone section. Again, this game is based on a game world that has thousands of pages of published story and game material. Most people, including the writers, don’t have every facet memorized. However, learning some basic details of the area you are from, some commonly used slang and in-character nasty words, and learning about some of the faiths and philosophy of the world will help you have a better time.
